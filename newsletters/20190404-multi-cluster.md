_How do you connect Kubernetes clusters located in different data centres?_

**It's a very popular question, and it's hard to tell what the right answer is.**

_Single cluster over a unified (stretched) network?_

_A proliferation of smaller clusters_?

There isn't much advice available on the internet.

But that isn't the only question that pops up frequently.

- **What is the difference between kubectl apply and create?**
- **Can you have an API Gateway as an ingress in Kubernetes?**
- **Is there any tool to visualise the dependency between YAML files?**
- **Is Helm used just for templating?**
- **How can I update my Deployments when the ConfigMap is changed?**

Those are some of the most popular questions that we see asked online and during our workshops.

We decide to take on the challenge.

**We launched _Bite-sized Kubernetes learning_** — a regular column on the most interesting questions that we see online and during our workshops answered by a Kubernetes expert.

The first issue is all about deploying across multiple clusters.

In the following weeks, you'll be able to read more answers.
