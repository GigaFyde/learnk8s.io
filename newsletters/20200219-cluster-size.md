Hey,

Ale here!

There are (at least) two important questions that you need to answer when designing a Kubernetes cluster:

1. **What Node size should you use?** A few powerful servers or maybe a copious number of smaller machines?
1. **Should you have a single large cluster?** Or a lot of smaller clusters? Or one per environment? Or a mix?

We discussed instance type for your cluster in [Architecting Kubernetes clusters — choosing a worker node size](https://learnk8s.io/kubernetes-node-size).

So [Daniel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/weibeld/) decided to write the follow-up article to discuss how many clusters you should have in your cluster.

Here's a preview of what you will find in the article:
