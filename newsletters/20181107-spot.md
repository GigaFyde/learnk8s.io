Did you know that cloud providers such as **Amazon Web Services and Azure offer unused virtual machines at a fraction of their cost?**

_How much discount?_

It's not uncommon to **save between 70 and 80%**.

_What the punchline, you say?_

The cloud provider will give you the unused resources at a cheaper price at one condition though: **if they ask, you need to return it back immediately.**

That's not great. You don't want your applications to suddenly disappear because the cloud provider reclaimed the compute resource.

But having an 80% discount on your cloud bill is just too tempting.

_If only there could be a workaround?_

Thankfully, **Cesar has the answer**.
