Have you ever noticed that we are more and more surrounded by devices that are _"connected"_?

[Amazon has talking microwaves](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/amazon-microwave-alexa), Samsung has [an oven that can be activated with an app](https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-reveals-smarter-integration-with-built-in-appliances-at-eurocucina-2018), and even [Ikea has a range of connected peripherals](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/products/lighting/smart-lighting/).

Even in solar plants, each solar panel features a small embedded computer capable of receiving and transmitting data over the air as well as driving the actuators to follow the sun.

**The internet of things is really everywhere.**

But if those connected devices are becoming more common...

_How do companies such as Amazon, Ikea and Samsung manage to keep their fleet of devices up to date?_

_How do they monitor devices for uptime?_

_How do they release updates efficiently?_

**And what happens when a device is lost or broken?** (e.g. you lose the connection to a solar panel due to bad weather)

In our newly released article, you will explore how to build the internet of things at scale, such as at the scale of a solar plant, with Kubernetes.

And interestingly, you will find that **orchestrating a fleet of IoT devices shares plenty of commonalities with building cloud infrastructure.**

And let us know what you think about it!
