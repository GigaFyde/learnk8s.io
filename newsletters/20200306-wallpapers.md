Happy Friday!

Ale here.

_Who doesn't love free stuff and Kubernetes?_

We commissioned a few wallpapers for the Learnk8s team:

But instead of keeping it for ourselves, we decided to give them away.

**So you can have them too!**

You download the wallpapers here:

The wallpaper below isn't released yet, but you can have it before everybody else:
