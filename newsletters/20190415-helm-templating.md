When you start using Kubernetes in different environments, you might see yourself copy-pasting the same YAML resources over and over.

**Don't!**

Helm is the Kubernetes templating engine that can help you keep your code _DRY_.

But Helm isn't *just* a templating engine.

**It's a lot more.**

In this article you will explore how you can use Helm as a package manager, templating engine and release manager.

You'll also learn how Kustomize (from SIG-machinery) is gaining popularity as a replacement for (certain parts of) Helm.
