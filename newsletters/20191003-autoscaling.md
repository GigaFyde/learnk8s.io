Hey there!

_TL;DR:_

- **We released a new course: autoscaling in Kubernetes!**
- We published an article on how to autoscale apps on Kubernetes with custom metrics

**How do you scale apps in production?**

You might have noticed that traffic patterns in production can change quickly.

Your app should be able to adapt to them:

- scale up to stay responsive and
- scale down to not waste resources.

**Kubernetes provides excellent support for autoscaling applications** in the form of the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA).

The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler can trigger scaling based on three kinds of metrics:

- _Resource metrics:_ predefined resource metrics such as CPU and memory
- _Custom metrics:_ metrics associated with a Kubernetes object but generated by the app
- _External metrics:_ custom metrics not related to a Kubernetes object and usually produced by third party services

In the following article, you will learn how to use it and how to collect metrics with the resource, custom and external metrics server.
