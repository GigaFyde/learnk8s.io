Hi there!

_Are you using Kubernetes and wish to get better at it?_

_How much Kubernetes is *enough* to deploy to production?_

_Do you have the skills to scale apps to thousands of users?_

Wait, you're just two clicks away from achieving those goals!

1. First announcement

**Today we're releasing our first FREE course to get started with Kubernetes and Node.js.**

The course is a hands-on course with written content and guided labs.

You will learn how to:

1. develop an application from scratch in Node.js and MongoDB
2. containerize it using Docker
3. deploy and scale your application on Amazon EKS

During the beta period, you told us that online material is great, but offline content is even better.

We listened to your feedback and made the course available as an ebook too.

2. Second announcement

We're opening the Learnk8s Academy to the public in one week time — on the 18th of September!

The catalogue of the Learnk8s Academy includes more focussed courses such as:

- Advanced deployment strategies
- Managing state
- Templating resources

Those courses are designed to level up your expertise in Kubernetes and containers.

We will share the discount code with you ahead of that day.
