Hi there!

_Are you using Kubernetes and wish to get better at it?_

_How much Kubernetes is *enough* to deploy to production?_

_Do you have the skills to scale apps to thousands of users?_

Wait, you're just two clicks away from achieving those goals!

**1Ô∏è‚É£üó£ First announcement**

**Today we're releasing our first FREE course to get started with Kubernetes and Node.js.**

The course is a hands-on course with written content and guided labs.

You will learn how to:

1. develop an application from scratch in Node.js and MongoDB
2. containerize it using Docker
3. deploy and scale your application on Amazon EKS

During the beta period, you told us that online material is great, but offline content is even better.

We listened to your feedback and made the course available as an ebook too.
