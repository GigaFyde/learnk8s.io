Hi there!

Dan here.

If you are hosting your cluster in the cloud, you might have had the following questions **at least once**:

_How do you configure cloud databases and message brokers in Kubernetes (e.g. AWS RDS, Azure SQL, GCP Cloud SQL)?_

_Do you create them outside the cluster?_

_Perhaps inside the cluster using Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)?_

I had those questions â€” and many of our students did too.

So here is an article that summarises your options:

[Provisioning cloud resources (AWS, GCP, Azure) in Kubernetes
](https://learnk8s.io/cloud-resources-kubernetes "Provisioning cloud resources (AWS, GCP, Azure) in Kubernetes")

I hope you enjoy it!

Stay safe,

Dan
