Not a day goes by and you do not hear about the latest developments in Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence/Machines taking over.

Be it a [self-driving taxi](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18126103/waymo-one-self-driving-taxi-service-ride-safety-alphabet-cost-app), [cancer detection](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnnosta/2018/09/18/you-might-want-artificial-intelligence-reading-your-next-mammogram/#3d25b99812d8) or [conquering board games](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/).

There is one thing behind it all: **data**. _Lots and lots of it!_

Analysing huge quantities of data presents the engineers and data scientists with its own challenges.

Instead of focusing on training and evaluating the algorithms you are forced to look at:

- resource management
- serving infrastructure
- monitoring
- configuration
- data collection

...the list goes on and on...

**If only there was something that could help?**

_There is..._

Enter: **Kubeflow**

Kubeflow is an open-source toolkit, designed to make deployment of machine learning workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable and scalable.

In our latest blog, Salman takes a look at the Kubeflow toolbox and how it helps in the design, training and scaling of machine learning models!

And let us know what you think about it!
